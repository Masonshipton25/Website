                <p id="p-dark-mode-change">My passion for programming began in high school, inspired by my Papa, who programmed in his free time and applied those skills in his career as a high school teacher in English, French, and Math. Back in the 1990s, he created a website for students to view notes, submit work, and ask questions—long before such tools became commonplace. He introduced me to Scratch and later Python, sparking my interest in Computer Science.</p>

                <p id="p-dark-mode-change">At the end of my first year of university, I became a research team lead for Lee Language Lab (L³), a language technology research laboratory focusing on language diversity and multilinguality. The laboratory is a collaboration between Ontario Tech University and the University of Toronto, and is under Prof. Annie En-Shiun Lee. This lab combines linguistics and technology, aligning with my bilingual background in English and French and my interest in how history and geography shape languages.</p>

                <p id="p-dark-mode-change">At L³, I led the development of URIEL+, a Python-based database of linguistic features for over 8,000 languages. This database significantly improved natural language processing (NLP) task performance by up to 50%, and our work was recognized with a paper accepted at COLING 2025. In addition, I played a key role in co-developing the NLP curriculum and assignments at Ontario Tech, earning the Audience Award at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference.</p>

            <p id="p-dark-mode-change">Currently, I'm spearheading the development of a database of writing systems, expanding the typological comprehensiveness of languages by up to 150%.
